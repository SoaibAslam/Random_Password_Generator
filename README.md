The Advanced Password Generator is a command-line tool developed in Python that allows users to generate highly secure and complex passwords according to specific requirements. 
It includes the following features:  Customizable password length.  Minimum requirements for digits, uppercase, lowercase, and special symbols.  Option to use custom symbols for enhanced password customization.  Password strength checking, classifying the generated password as "Weak," "Moderate," or "Strong" based on its complexity.  The generated passwords are stored in a file with an expiration date to ensure periodic password updates. This project was designed to assist users in creating passwords that meet the high- security standards needed for various systems, especially those requiring complex, hard-to-guess passwords.
